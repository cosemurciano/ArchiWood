2. Activate **Wood House Designer** from the WordPress Plugins page.
3. Configure the default grid size, scale ratio and canvas size from **Settings â†’ Wood House Designer**.
4. Create a page and either:

   - Assign the **Wood House Designer App** page template to render the full application layout.

## Features
